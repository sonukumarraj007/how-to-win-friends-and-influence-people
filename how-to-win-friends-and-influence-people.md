# How to Win Friends and Influence People (Dale Carnegie)

**Q**: What is required to be able to master social skills?
**A**: A deep, driving desire to understand people.

# 1: If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive.
- If Al Capone, "Two Gun" Crowly, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind the prison walls don't blame themselves for anything -- what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?
- Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.
- "Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof when your own doorstep is unclean." -- Confucius
- Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain -- and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.
- God himself does not propose to judge man until the end of his days. Why should you and I?

## Don't Criticize, condemn or complain.

# 2: The big secret of dealing with people

- There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.
- This desire (feeling o importance) makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest cars and talk about your brilliant children.
- **If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.**
- "I consider amy ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I posses, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambition of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise."
- **People would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or employees go for six days without food; but they will let them go for six days, and six weeks and sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.**
- **The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef that it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.**
- Lets try to figure out the other person's good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise", and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime -- repeat them years after you have forgotten them.

## Give honest and sincere appreciation

# 3. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.

- Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.
- So the only way on earth to Influence other people is to talk about what **they** want and show them how to get it.
- If out of reading this book you get just one thing -- and increased tendency to think always in terms of other people's point of view, and see things from their angle -- if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.
- First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.

# 5: A simple way to make a good first impression

- Two people may be in the same place, doing the same thing; both may have about an equal amount of money and prestige -- and yet one may be miserable and the other happy. Why? Because of a different mental attitude.
- "There is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so" -- Shakespear

- Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you", "Would you be so kind as to _____", "Won't you please?", "Would you mind?", "Thank you" -- little courtesies like these oil the cogs of monotonous grind of everyday life -- and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.

# 10: You can't win an argument

- There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument -- and that is to avoid it.
- Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.
- If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will.
- Buddha said: "Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love", and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person's viewpoint.

- **If you are going to prove anything, don't let anybody know it.** Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it.
    - Men must be taught as if you taught them not, And things unknown proposed as things forgot.
    - You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.
    - Be wiser than the other people if you can; but do not tell them so.
    - One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.
- "I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion."

## Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong"

- The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred of mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams.
